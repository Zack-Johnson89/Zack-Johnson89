**Computer Science Student at UTS**

Im a student currently studying at the University of Technology Sydney. I am studying a Bachelor's of Computer Science (Honours) and am in my 2nd year.
I have a Passion for computers and code stemming from my youth as an avid gamer. I recieved a Band 6 in Software Design and Devlopment and recieved 100% in my final 
coding project in which I coded a 2-Player chess board. I participate in the AEL Elite Series Rocket League Tournament alongside the UTS E-Sports team, am a part of the UTS Bouldering society and the UTS car society. I am confident in Java, Python and C# accompanied by a basic knowledge of HTML 5, CSS, Unity and C++.

 <summary><h3> Zack's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My coding journey began in highschool almost as soon as I bought my first computer. Up until that point I had rarely touched computers with the capability to run games and my parents had always owned macs. This opened the door for what will hopefully be my career for the future. I began coding in highschool as a side project for some extra credit in an Information and software technology class and found out that not only was I decent at learning it but I enjoyed it! Since then the rest is history I continued to write and produce code in SDD and play games and we are here with you taking the time to read my Github README so thank you!
